## CONCEPT
### As a final project for the Fall 2020 cohort and a way to thank Innovate Birmingham for the technical education, personal support and professional development training we have received over the past several months, our team has proposed to collaborate with the Innovate Birmingham staff to design, develop and implement a 'student' portal for use by future candidates of the program.

## INTENT
### The Candidate Portal is being designed as a suppliment to the education of future candidates and will focus primarily on supporting the professional development training already provided by the Innovate Birmingham staff.  

## TECHNICAL
### The Candidate Portal is being developed via:
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Typescript
- React
- Express
- Node
- Sass
- MySql
